This branch contains the code of the [sixth](http://streamdata.io/blog/exploring-riot-js-part4/) posts of our series around [Riot.js](http://riotjs.com/).

#Starting the sample

In a terminal, run those two commands:
- `npm run install`
- `npm run serve` (live-edit)

A browser should be opened at: `http://localhost:3000/app/`
