#Event-driven app with Riot.js

This branch contains the code of the [third](http://streamdata.io/blog/exploring-riot-js-part-3-1/), [fourth](http://streamdata.io/blog/exploring-riot-js-part3-2/) and [fifth](http://streamdata.io/blog/exploring-riot-js-part3-3/) posts of our series around [Riot.js](http://riotjs.com/).

#Setup the sample

In a terminal, run this command:
- `npm run install`

#Add the Streamdata.io authentication token

Sign up for free on [Streamdata.io developer portal](https://portal.streamdata.io/#/login) and create a new application. You'll find your token in the 'security' section.

Paste this token in `index.html`, line 32.

#Run the sample

Back in your terminal, run this command:
- `npm run serve` (live-edit)

A browser should be opened at: `http://localhost:3000/app/`
